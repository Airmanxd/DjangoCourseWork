Uses reactstrap 8 with bootstrap 4 and redux toolkit. Forms are handled as a single component - forms.jsx, which varies based on the form activated. giflist.jsx diplays the gif and handles the infinite scroll, as well as likes, header.jsx is just a navbar, searchbar.jsx handles searching tags and activating them, activetags.jsx displays the activated tags and handles removing them on click.
